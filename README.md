# ðŸ‘¼ lil hero tumblr saver
### a thing to help when your browser crashes
We've all been there: you're writing a post in your IBoC (Interwebical Browser of Choiceâ„¢), and then something happens -- it crashes, your battery dies, or something else completely random. lil hero was created to make those situations feel a little less crappy.

## how to use
See the [home page](https://rawgit.com/skylineproject/lilhero/master/index.html).

## the cool things
- lil hero currently only works on Tumblr, but will eventually work with any TinyMCE-based text editor. (That means Drupal, Wordpress, Moodle, and others are in the works!)
- After you've told it you'd like to start saving this post as a draft, lil hero will automatically save your text box as a draft every second.
- lil hero has been tested to work with Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, and uses web standards, so you can use it on practically any computer (it probably even works on IE!). For those of you who like the JavaScript thing, it uses the localStorage API to do its magic.
## the less cool things
- lil hero loses access to anything you may have saved after you clear your cache and cookies.
- lil hero is not guaranteed to do anything, but might do something helpful.
- There is currently no way to stop saving short of closing the window. That will be changed shortly.
- I am not omniscient, there might be things that break lil hero that I couldn't have possibly anticipated. If you found one of these things, let me know by opening an Issue, and we'll track it down.

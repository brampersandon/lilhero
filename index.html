  <h3>a thing to help when your browser crashes</h3>
  <p>We've all been there: you're writing a post in your IBoC (Interwebical Browser of Choice&#8482;), and then something happens -- it crashes, your battery dies, or something else completely random. lil hero was created to make those situations feel a little less crappy.</p>
  <h2>how to use</h2>
  <li>drag this bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar:
    <p style="margin-left:10px;">
      <a id="bml" href="javascript:(function(){lh=document.createElement('SCRIPT');lh.type='text/javascript';lh.src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skylineproject/lilhero/master/lh.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(lh);})();">&#128124; lil hero tumblr saver</a>
    </p></li>
    <li>open a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/new/text">new text post in Tumblr</a></li>
    <li>and click on the <strong>lil hero bookmarklet</strong>.</li>
    <h4>saving a post</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Click <strong>&#9654; save</strong>. lil hero will now save your post every second until you send it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>restoring a post</h4>
      <p>Stuff got weird, and you want to get it back. That's what lil hero's here for.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>&#8617; restore</strong>. lil hero will bring your post back from the ether.</li>
        <p>OR</p>
        <li>Click <strong>&#8599; open last save in new window</strong>, and a new window will pop up, with the content of that post.</li>
      </ol>
  <h2>head's up</h2>
  <h3>the cool things</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>lil hero currently only works on Tumblr, but will eventually work with any <a href="http://www.tinymce.com">TinyMCE-based</a> text editor. (That means Drupal, Wordpress, Moodle, and others are in the works!)</li>
    <li>After you've told it you'd like to start saving this post as a draft, lil hero will automatically save your text box as a draft every second.</li>
    <li>lil hero has been tested to work with Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, and uses web standards, so you can use it on practically any computer (it *probably* even works on IE!). For those of you who like the JavaScript thing, it uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">localStorage API</a> to do its magic.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>the less cool things</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>lil hero loses access to anything you may have saved after you clear your cache and cookies.</li>
    <li>lil hero is not guaranteed to do anything, but might do something helpful.</li>
    <li>There is currently no way to stop saving short of closing the window. That will be changed shortly</li>
    <li>I am not omniscient, there might be things that break lil hero that I couldn't have possibly anticipated. If you found one of these things, <a href="">let me know</a>, and we'll track it down.</li>
  </ul>
